A terraform module to each of these logical components in github:

1. S3 Cloudfront Website
2. Amplify Frontend Application with Cognito
3. API Gateway and Lambdas Serverless Stack

Utilized each module to write another terraform project that includes all 3 modules.

Created other modules as well: IAM, VPC.

I have placed locals for tags in locals.tf

# terraform-test-modules-2
